## About
I work on the mathematical foundations of deep learning, focusing on universality, geometry, and the structure of function spaces. I am strongly problem-driven: I enjoy working on hard questions regardless of their mathematical domain, and I adapt tools from different areas as needed.

## Current Focus
- Aproximation and generalization capacity of neural networks
- Geometric deep learning and representation theory
- Unsupervised learning

## Past projects
- **Thesis — Theoretical analysis on LLMs language understanding capacities**  
  Formalizing neural network universal capacities of language understanding.
- **Anommaly detector procedure for wearable ECG**  
  Eficient and interpretable new graph based online classifier.
- **Polynomial graph class recognition algorithm**  
  Develope a theory of a graph class defined by prohibited patterns to make a recognition algorithm.

## Background
MSc in Data Science with a strong mathematical background.
