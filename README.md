## About
I work on the mathematical foundations of deep learning, focusing on universality, geometry, and the structure of function spaces.

## Current Focus
- Universality of symmetry-preserving architectures  
- Geometric deep learning and operators on probability measures  
- Functional-analytic perspectives on transformers and LLMs  

## Selected Projects
- **Thesis — Geometric Deep Learning**  
  Framework for universality and symmetry in deep models.
- **Statistical Modeling of Echocardiograms**  
  Probabilistic modeling with structural constraints.
- **Graph Structure and Invariance**  
  Studying invariance and limitations of graph-based models.

## Background
MSc in Data Science with a strong mathematical background.
